            <p>I am going to be broad and paint with a broad brush. 
            I understand this as another piece in the principle position of a particularly strong variant of marxism: American race infused marxism. 
            These sound like buzz words and I don't mean them too. I think this accurately describes where we are at. To elaborate I see marxism as the foundation because it understands the world in economic class based hierarchy, 
            with the moral always resting with worker/proletariat/oppressed. Race becomes infused in a colonial context of another people colonizing another. 
            This by extension, sees the moral always with the minority and not with the majority, as they take on the capitalist v worker framework of marxism. 
            This is why everything revolves around race. 
            Marxism sees everything in that context of class, and so everything must return to it, thats why the spirituality of Hegel is incorporated, its the backbone of marxism because it understands the world as the dialectic between two opposing forces: even the universe is the oppressed vs oppressor. Infusing race takes this dichotomy and sets it behind the eternal struggle between the majority race and the minority race, the colonizer and the colonialist, the enslavers and the enslaved.
            This gives me moral pause in the same way marxism does: giving morality because of position and not action, robs individuals of a responsibility to morality, and in doing so gives no one the ability to be moral because it is always tied into oppressor v oppressed. 
            A rich man helping another rich man who is in debt and needs help is doing nothing but perpetuating the oppressor class, for example. This refuses to look at the individual, regardless of situation as a potential and expected moral actor. 
            We have the tendency to do the same thing with Black White relationships in the states, among other things this has a way of undermining actual working relationships into an always fractured, always opposed, meeting of two irrevocable things. 
            Well, irrevocable until Hegelian synthesis, but I know what that means, it is something both messianic in principle and a reversal of roles in practice. And that underlines the moral issue. If morality rests with the oppressed, and they rise up, break free from the oppressor and take power, how long until they become the oppressor? </p>
