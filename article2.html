        <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">Emotional immune response: 

            One of the greek dramatist, in fact maybe socrates (Plato), made the observation that plays are good for society because they prick an emotional immune response. It excerises the part of the brain and the heart that is sympathetic, you are then more open to caring about other people. Its like medicine, giving the patient a smaller controlled immune response, so they are more capable of dealing with it in the future. Here medine and art work like color and light. Black on paper is every coior, Black in light is its absence (thinking about substance its a united metaphor, A black car absorbs every spectrum, and reflects none of it, a white car reflects every spectrum, they get to different temperatures in the sun. Art is what bubbles out from the depths of the body outside, medicine is what comes from outside that goes to the depths of the body. Which is really receiving vs giving. Art is taken in like medicine, from, out to where it started from. If we see art as emdince, in todays world a lot of people are addicts and ODing. Two things (of many) result: people become incredibly open, too open, too soft, too swayed, their emotional gates are wide open and what's quiet becomes loud and what's loud becomes deafing. Or, people b ecome calloused and cold. They are so over espoused that their body has changed what it defines as normal. They seem to like Ryan Renoylds movies. Video games are part of both of these conditions. We need remedial therapies.
            
             If we take this premise to todays world I think what we see is an over activated emotional immune response.
