        <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4"> 
        <p>“A tragedy is the imitation of an action that is serious and also, as having magnitude, complete in itself . . . with incidents arousing pity and fear, wherewith to accomplish its catharsis of such emotions.” (Aristotle, Poetics chapter 6)
            
            Above is Aristotle's observation about drama. That plays are good for society because they prick an emotional immune response, arousing pity and fear and then releasing them. It's an exercise in exercise, it works the part of the brain + heart that is sympathetic with the goal of making you more open in the same way stretching makes you more flexible. 
            Medicine can work the same way. 
            It gives the patient a smaller controlled immune response to a pathogen, so they are more capable of dealing with it in the future. 
            Art is taken in like medicine, from the outside to the depths of the body. 
            If we think of art like medicine in today's world a lot of people are addicted and overdosing. Two things (of many) result: people become incredibly open, too open, too soft, too swayed, their emotional gates are wide open and what's quiet becomes loud and what's loud becomes deafening. 
            Or people become calloused and cold. They are so over-espoused that their body has changed what it defines as normal. They seem to like Ryan Renoylds movies. 
            Video games are part of both of these conditions.
